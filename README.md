# DT228 Object Oriented Programming Assignment 1

## Dataset
This submission uses a dataset that contains all the spacecraft launches from 1957 to 2014. It contains the names of the launch vehicles, payloads, country of origin, and date where available. The country is written in an abreviated form with the full name available in a second file.

## Plan
* In this project I plan to have at least a line graph, a bar graph, a scatter plots graph and a pictograph. Moreover, each graph will have multiple options in which to display the data such as to only show the launches between certain years or to only show the launches made by a certain nation
* The graphs will be easily accessible from a menu that starts at the beginning of the program and can be returned to at any time
* The loading and initialisation of the data will be done at the beginning of the program so there shouldn't be any delay in opening any of the graphs at any time
* I will use classes
* The library ControlP5 will be used to draw the buttons, toggles, text boxes and other objects
* It will also contain animations at certain times
